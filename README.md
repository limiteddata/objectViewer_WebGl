**objectViewer_WebGl**

This is a viewer made in javascript using webgl and gl_matrix. You can use your mouse to rotate the camera and select objects, wasd and arrow keys to move the selected object, spawn new objects, select and insert new textures and save the final image and more.
It's a little trashy but it works! :)
